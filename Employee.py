"""
You are building a system to model different types of employees in an organization. Employees can be either full-time or part-time. The system needs to calculate the monthly salary of each employee based on their working hours and rate of pay.

The requirements are:

Create an abstract class Employee with:

An abstract method calculate_salary() to compute the employeeâ€™s salary.
A constructor (__init__) that takes the name of the employee and initializes it.
An instance method describe() that prints the employee's name and type.
Create two subclasses FullTimeEmployee and PartTimeEmployee that inherit from Employee:

The FullTimeEmployee class should have a fixed monthly salary of $3000 and should implement the calculate_salary() method to return this salary.
The PartTimeEmployee class should have a hours_worked and hourly_rate attribute. The calculate_salary() method should compute the salary as hours_worked * hourly_rate.
Demonstrate how to:

Create instances of FullTimeEmployee and PartTimeEmployee.
Use the describe() method.
Call the calculate_salary() method to compute the salary.
